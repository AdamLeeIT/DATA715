With the increasing availability of electronic health records and sensor-derived patient data, digital twins offer significant potential for applications in the healthcare sector. METHODS: This article presents a scalable full-stack architecture for a patient simulation application driven by graph-based models. This patient simulation application enables medical practitioners and trainees to simulate the trajectory of critically ill patients with sepsis. Directed acyclic graphs are utilized to model the complex underlying causal pathways that focus on the physiological interactions and medication effects relevant to the first 6 h of critical illness. To realize the sepsis patient simulation at scale, we propose an application architecture with three core components, a cross-platform frontend application that clinicians and trainees use to run the simulation, a simulation engine hosted in the cloud on a serverless function that performs all of the computations, and a graph database that hosts the graph model utilized by the simulation engine to determine the progression of each simulation. RESULTS: A short case study is presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed simulation architecture. DISCUSSION: The proposed patient simulation application could help train future generations of healthcare professionals and could be used to facilitate clinicians' bedside decision-making.\", \"CI\": [\"Copyright (c) 2024 Trevena, Zhong, Lal, Rovati, Cubro, Dong, Schulte and Gajic.\"], \"FAU\": [\"Trevena, William\", \"Zhong, Xiang\", \"Lal, Amos\", \"Rovati, Lucrezia\", \"Cubro, Edin\", \"Dong, Yue\", \"Schulte, Phillip\", \"Gajic, Ognjen\"], \"AU\": [\"Trevena W\", \"Zhong X\", \"Lal A\", \"Rovati L\", \"Cubro E\", \"Dong Y\", \"Schulte P\", \"Gajic O\"], \"AD\": [\"Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States.\", \"Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States.\", \"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.\", \"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.\", \"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.\", \"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.\", \"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.\", \"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.\"], \"LA\": [\"eng\"], \"PT\": [\"Journal Article\"], \"DEP\": \"20240812\", \"PL\": \"Switzerland\", \"TA\": \"Front Physiol\", \"JT\": \"Frontiers in physiology\", \"JID\": \"101549006\", \"PMC\": \"PMC11345177\", \"OTO\": [\"NOTNLM\"], \"OT\": [\"critical care\", \"digital twin\", \"full-stack application architecture\", \"graph model\", \"virtual patient simulation\"], \"COIS\": [\"The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\", \"commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\", \"conflict of interest.\"], \"EDAT\": \"2024/08/27 09:50\", \"MHDA\": \"2024/08/27 09:51\", \"PMCR\": [\"2024/08/12\"], \"CRDT\": [\"2024/08/27 04:26\"], \"PHST\": [\"2024/04/28 00:00 [received]\", \"2024/07/19 00:00 [accepted]\", \"2024/08/27 09:51 [medline]\", \"2024/08/27 09:50 [pubmed]\", \"2024/08/27 04:26 [entrez]\", \"2024/08/12 00:00 [pmc-release]\"], \"AID\": [\"1424931 [pii]\", \"10.3389/fphys.2024.1424931 [doi]\"], \"PST\": \"epublish\", \"SO\": \"Front Physiol. 2024 Aug 12;15:1424931. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2024.1424931. eCollection 2024.\"}, {\"PMID\": \"38931546\", \"OWN\": \"NLM\", \"STAT\": \"PubMed-not-MEDLINE\", \"LR\": \"20240629\", \"IS\": \"1424-8220 (Electronic) 1424-8220 (Linking)\", \"VI\": \"24\", \"IP\": \"12\", \"DP\": \"2024 Jun 9\", \"TI\": \"Digital Twin Smart City: Integrating IFC and CityGML with Semantic Graph for Advanced 3D City Model Visualization.\", \"LID\": \"10.3390/s24123761 [doi] 3761\", \"AB\": \"The growing interest in building data management, especially the building information model (BIM), has significantly influenced urban management, materials supply chain analysis, documentation, and storage. However, the integration of BIM into 3D GIS tools is becoming more common, showing progress beyond the traditional problem. To address this, this study proposes data transformation methods involving mapping between three domains: industry foundation classes (IFC), city geometry markup language (CityGML), and web ontology framework (OWL)/resource description framework (RDF). Initially, IFC data are converted to CityGML format using the feature manipulation engine (FME) at CityGML standard's levels of detail 4 (LOD4) to enhance BIM data interoperability. Subsequently, CityGML is converted to the OWL/RDF diagram format to validate the proposed BIM conversion process. To ensure integration between BIM and GIS, geometric data and information are visualized through Cesium Ion web services and Unreal Engine. Additionally, an RDF graph is applied to analyze the association between the semantic mapping of the CityGML standard, with Neo4j (a graph database management system) utilized for visualization. The study's results demonstrate that the proposed data transformation methods significantly improve the interoperability and visualization of 3D city models, facilitating better urban management and planning.\", \"FAU\": [\"Lam, Phuoc-Dat\", \"Gu, Bon-Hyon\", \"Lam, Hoang-Khanh\", \"Ok, Soo-Yol\", \"Lee, Suk-Hwan\"], \"AU\": [\"Lam PD\", \"Gu BH\", \"Lam HK\", \"Ok SY\", \"Lee SH\"], \"AUID\": [\"ORCID: 0009-0002-7893-5642\", \"ORCID: 0000-0003-4779-2888\"], \"AD\": [\"Department of Computer Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea.\", \"Department of Computer Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea.\", \"Department of Computer Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea.\", \"Department of Computer Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea.\", \"Department of Computer Engineering, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea.\"], \"LA\": [\"eng\"], \"GR\": [\"2022-0-00622/Institute for Information & Technology Promotion (IITP)/\"], \"PT\": [\"Journal Article\"], \"DEP\": \"20240609\", \"PL\": \"Switzerland\", \"TA\": \"Sensors (Basel)\", \"JT\": \"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)\", \"JID\": \"101204366\", \"SB\": \"IM\", \"PMC\": \"PMC11207653\", \"OTO\": [\"NOTNLM\"], \"OT\": [\"3D visualization\", \"CityGML\", \"building information model (BIM)\", \"digital twin\", \"industry foundation classes (IFC)\", \"smart city\"], \"COIS\": [\"The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\"], \"EDAT\": \"2024/06/27 06:42\", \"MHDA\": \"2024/06/27 06:43\", \"PMCR\": [\"2024/06/09\"], \"CRDT\": [\"2024/06/27 01:23\"], \"PHST\": [\"2024/05/03 00:00 [received]\", \"2024/06/02 00:00 [revised]\", \"2024/06/07 00:00 [accepted]\", \"2024/06/27 06:43 [medline]\", \"2024/06/27 06:42 [pubmed]\", \"2024/06/27 01:23 [entrez]\", \"2024/06/09 00:00 [pmc-release]\"], \"AID\": [\"s24123761 [pii]\", \"sensors-24-03761 [pii]\", \"10.3390/s24123761 [doi]\"], \"PST\": \"epublish\", \"SO\": \"Sensors (Basel). 2024 Jun 9;24(12):3761. doi: 10.3390/s24123761.\"}, {\"PMID\": \"38885013\", \"OWN\": \"NLM\", \"STAT\": \"MEDLINE\", \"DCOM\": \"20240617\", \"LR\": \"20240704\", \"IS\": \"1438-8871 (Electronic) 1439-4456 (Print) 1438-8871 (Linking)\", \"VI\": \"26\", \"DP\": \"2024 Jun 17\", \"TI\": \"Diverse Mentoring Connections Across Institutional Boundaries in the Biomedical Sciences: Innovative Graph Database Analysis.\", \"PG\": \"e47560\", \"LID\": \"10.2196/47560 [doi] e47560\", \"AB\": \"BACKGROUND: With an overarching goal of increasing diversity and inclusion in biomedical sciences, the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) developed a web-based national mentoring platform (MyNRMN) that seeks to connect mentors and mentees to support the persistence of underrepresented minorities in the biomedical sciences. As of May 15, 2024, the MyNRMN platform, which provides mentoring, networking, and professional development tools, has facilitated more than 12,100 unique mentoring connections between faculty, students, and researchers in the biomedical domain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the large-scale mentoring connections facilitated by our web-based platform between students (mentees) and faculty (mentors) across institutional and geographic boundaries. Using an innovative graph database, we analyzed diverse mentoring connections between mentors and mentees across demographic characteristics in the biomedical sciences. METHODS: Through the MyNRMN platform, we observed profile data and analyzed mentoring connections made between students and faculty across institutional boundaries by race, ethnicity, gender, institution type, and educational attainment between July 1, 2016, and May 31, 2021. RESULTS: In total, there were 15,024 connections with 2222 mentees and 1652 mentors across 1625 institutions contributing data. Female mentees participated in the highest number of connections (3996/6108, 65%), whereas female mentors participated in 58% (5206/8916) of the connections. Black mentees made up 38% (2297/6108) of the connections, whereas White mentors participated in 56% (5036/8916) of the connections. Mentees were predominately from institutions classified as Research 1 (R1; doctoral universities-very high research activity) and historically Black colleges and universities (556/2222, 25% and 307/2222, 14%, respectively), whereas 31% (504/1652) of mentors were from R1 institutions.

Each Hadith contains three main parts: the ISNAD (chain of narrators), TARAF (starting part, often from Prophet Muhammad), and MATN (Hadith content). ISNAD, a chain of narrators involved in transmitting that particular MATN. Hadith scholars determine the trustworthiness of the transmitted MATN by the quality of the ISNAD. The ISNAD's data is available in its original Arabic language, with narrator names transliterated into English. This paper presents the Multi-IsnadSet (MIS), that has great potential to be employed by the social scientist and theologist. A multi-directed graph structure is used to represents the complex interactions among the narrators of Hadith. The MIS dataset represent directed graph which consists of 2092 nodes, representing individual narrators, and 77,797 edges represent the Sanad-Hadith connections. The MIS dataset represents multiple ISNAD of the Hadith based on the Sahih Muslim Hadith book. The dataset was carefully extracted from online multiple Hadith sources using data scraping and web crawling techniques tools, providing extensive Hadith details. Each dataset entry provides a complete view of a specific Hadith, including the original book, Hadith number, textual content (MATN), list of narrators, narrator count, sequence of narrators, and ISNAD count. In this paper, four different tools were designed and constructed for modeling and analyzing narrative network such as python library (NetworkX), powerful graph database Neo4j and two different network analysis tools named Gephi and CytoScape. The Neo4j graph database is used to represent the multi-dimensional graph related data for the ease of extraction and establishing new relationships among nodes. Researchers can use MIS to explore Hadith credibility including classification of Hadiths (Sahih=perfection in the Sanad/Dhaif=imperfection in the Sanad), and narrators (trustworthy/not). Traditionally, scholars have focused on identifying the longest and shortest Sanad between two Narrators, but in MIS, the emphasis shifts to determining the optimum/authentic Sanad, considering narrator qualities. The graph representation of the authentic and manually curated dataset will open ways for the development of computational models that could identify the significance of a chain and a narrator. The dataset allows the researchers to provide Hadith narrators and Hadith ISNAD that could be used in a wide variety of future research studies related to Hadith authentication and rules extraction. Moreover, the dataset encourages cross-disciplinary research, bridging the gap between Islamic studies, artificial intelligence (AI), social network analysis (SNA), and Graph Neural Network (GNN).\", \"CI\": [\"(c) 2024 The Authors.\"], \"FAU\": [\"Farooqi, Aziz Mehmood\", \"Malick, Rauf Ahmed Shams\", \"Shaikh, Muhammad Shahzad\", \"Akhunzada, Adnan\"], \"AU\": [\"Farooqi AM\", \"Malick RAS\", \"Shaikh MS\", \"Akhunzada A\"], \"AD\": [\"College of Computing and Information Sciences PAF Karachi Institute of Economics and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan.\", \"Department of Computer Science, FAST-National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Karachi 75300, Pakistan.\", \"Department of Computer Science, FAST-National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Karachi 75300, Pakistan.\", \"Al-Ghazali University, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.\", \"Department of Sciences and Humanities, FAST-National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Karachi 75300, Pakistan.\", \"College of Computing & IT, University of Doha for Science and Technology, P.O.

In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the vertex model. Since these transitions are not yet mathematically properly formulated, the 3D vertex model is generally difficult to implement. The few existing implementations rely on highly customized and complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. To solve this outstanding problem, we propose a reformulation of the vertex model. Our approach, called Graph Vertex Model (GVM), is based on storing the topology of the cell network into a knowledge graph with a particular data structure that allows performing cell-rearrangement events by simple graph transformations. Importantly, when these same transformations are applied to a two-dimensional (2D) polygonal cell aggregate, they reduce to a well-known T1 transition, thereby generalizing cell-rearrangements in 2D and 3D space-filling packings. This result suggests that the GVM's graph data structure may be the most natural representation of cell aggregates and tissues. We also develop a Python package that implements GVM, relying on a graph-database-management framework Neo4j. We use this package to characterize an order-disorder transition in 3D cell aggregates, driven by active noise and we find aggregates undergoing efficient ordering close to the transition point. In all, our work showcases knowledge graphs as particularly suitable data models for structured storage, analysis, and manipulation of tissue data.\", \"CI\": [\"Copyright: (c) 2024 Sarkar, Krajnc.

Although this has resulted in calls for more holistic and personalized approaches to prescribing, progress toward these goals has remained slow. With the rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) methods, promising approaches now also exist to accelerate the advance of precision medicine in multimorbidity. These include analyzing disease comorbidity networks, using knowledge graphs that integrate knowledge from different medical domains, and applying network analysis and graph ML. Multimorbidity disease networks have been used to improve disease diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and patient prognosis. Knowledge graphs that combine different medical entities connected by multiple relationship types integrate data from different sources, allowing for complex interactions and creating a continuous flow of information. Network analysis and graph ML can then extract the topology and structure of networks and reveal hidden properties, including disease phenotypes, network hubs, and pathways; predict drugs for repurposing; and determine safe and more holistic treatments. In this article, we describe the basic concepts of creating bipartite and unipartite disease and patient networks and review the use of knowledge graphs, graph algorithms, graph embedding methods, and graph ML within the context of multimorbidity. Specifically, we provide an overview of the application of graph theory for studying multimorbidity, the methods employed to extract knowledge from graphs, and examples of the application of disease networks for determining the structure and pathways of multimorbidity, identifying disease phenotypes, predicting health outcomes, and selecting safe and effective treatments.

It stores many types of data and complex relationships, complicating data management and analysis. Traditional database management systems struggle to effectively capture these complex networks of interactions within biological systems. Graph-oriented databases perform well in managing interactions between different entities. We present neo4jsbml, a new solution that bridges the gap between the Systems Biology Markup Language data and the Neo4j database, for storing, querying and analyzing data. The Systems Biology Markup Language organizes biological entities in a hierarchical structure, reflecting their interdependencies. The inherent graphical structure represents these hierarchical relationships, offering a natural and efficient means of navigating and exploring the model's components. Neo4j is an excellent solution for handling this type of data. By representing entities as nodes and their relationships as edges, Cypher, Neo4j's query language, efficiently traverses this type of graph representing complex biological networks. We have developed neo4jsbml, a Python library for importing Systems Biology Markup Language data into a Neo4j database using a user-defined schema. By leveraging Neo4j's graphical database technology, exploration of complex biological networks becomes intuitive and information retrieval efficient. Neo4jsbml is a tool designed to import Systems Biology Markup Language data into a Neo4j database.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse event data were integrated into a knowledge graph to support vaccine safety surveillance and nimbly respond to urgent health authority questions. Here, we provide details of this post-marketing safety system using public data sources. In addition to challenges with varied data representations, adverse event reporting on the COVID-19 vaccines generated an unprecedented volume of data; an order of magnitude larger than adverse events for all previous vaccines. The Patient Safety Knowledge Graph (PSKG) is a robust data store to accommodate the volume of adverse event data and harmonize primary surveillance data sources. METHODS: We designed a semantic model to represent key safety concepts. We built an extract-transform-load (ETL) data pipeline to parse and import primary public data sources; align key elements such as vaccine names; integrated the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA); and applied quality metrics. PSKG is deployed in a Neo4J graph database, and made available via a web interface and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). RESULTS: We import and align adverse event data and vaccine exposure data from 250 countries on a weekly basis, producing a graph with 4,340,980 nodes and 30,544,475 edges as of July 1, 2022. PSKG is used for ad-hoc analyses and periodic reporting for several widely available COVID-19 vaccines. Analysis code using the knowledge graph is 80% shorter than an equivalent implementation written entirely in Python, and runs over 200 times faster. CONCLUSIONS: Organizing safety data into a concise model of nodes, properties, and edge relationships has greatly simplified analysis code by removing complex parsing and transformation algorithms from individual analyses and instead managing these centrally. The adoption of the knowledge graph transformed how the team answers key scientific and medical questions. Whereas previously an analysis would involve aggregating and transforming primary datasets from scratch to answer a specific question, the team can now iterate easily and respond as quickly as requests evolve (e.g., \\\"Produce vaccine-X safety profile for adverse event-Y by country instead of age-range\\\").\", \"CI\": [\"(c) 2023.

However, this data is usually heterogeneous, requiring its harmonization to be integrated and analysed. We propose a semantic-driven harmonization framework that (1) enables the meaningful sharing and integration of healthcare data across institutions and (2) facilitates the analysis and exploitation of the shared data. METHODS: The framework includes an ontology-based common data model (i.e. SCDM), a data transformation pipeline and a semantic query system. Heterogeneous datasets, mapped to different terminologies, are integrated by using an ontology-based infrastructure rooted in a top-level ontology. A graph database is generated by using these mappings, and web-based semantic query system facilitates data exploration. RESULTS: Several datasets from different European institutions have been integrated by using the framework in the context of the European H2020 Precise4Q project. Through the query system, data scientists were able to explore data and use it for building machine learning models. CONCLUSIONS: The flexible data representation using RDF, together with the formal semantic underpinning provided by the SCDM, have enabled the semantic integration, query and advanced exploitation of heterogeneous data in the context of the Precise4Q project.\", \"CI\": [\"Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s).
